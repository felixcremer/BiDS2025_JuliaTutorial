title: Introduction to the Package Manager
---

This is only a small glimpse in the Julia package manager. 
For an in depth intro see [Pkg.jl and Julia Environments for Beginners](https://jkrumbiegel.com/pages/2022-08-26-pkg-introduction/).

# REPL package manager mode

There are two ways to interact with the package manager.
Either programmatically by loading it in via `using Pkg` or by switching to the pkg mode in the REPL.
Here we will use the REPL mode. 
To switch to the pkg mode use the closing square bracket.
```julia
]
```

This will switch the prompt of your REPL and now you can do package management tasks.

::: {.callout-note}
From now on we will assume you are in the pkg REPL mode
